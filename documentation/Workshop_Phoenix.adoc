= Elixir Phoenix Workshop

== What we will build

A very minimalistic version of a Chat App, with Phoenix
Features will include : 

- User Management
- Form Authentication
- JWT token for session management
- Minimal (very very) Chat interface
- Room Management

NOTE: Let's dig in

== Create a Phoenix App - tag : creation

We will build an App called Slang, Sla for Slack, and ng because why not!?! +
The name of the app will be used in Module name, so if you want to be able to copy paste easily use `slang` as App name

[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.new *_folder_name_* --app slang
----

It will generate a Phoenix Project in the folder specified
You will get asked to download dependencies, you can safely accept :D

=== A tour of the Generated Code

[source, subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
|
|_ \_build # where the package will be build
|_ assets  # static assets, Javascript, CSS, images, webpack
|_ config  # conf for the app
|_ deps    # dependencies binaries
|_ lib     # it's where our code will be.
|_ priv    # database migration and target for static build
|_ test    # TESTS for the sake of your mind!
mix.exs    # project description, dependencies, build config
README.md  # teh README, every project need one
----
Not too much spoiler, I will get in lengthy details :) Ask me for more during the workshop!

=== Run the project

First Create your database, and run the migrations
[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
----


now let's open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/

image::first_phoenix_screen.png[]

if you see something like that, you are on the right path fellow Elixirian :)

== Authentication debut, User Creation 

We will use another code generator.
To generate the different form for our users management

Let's go : 
[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.gen.html Accounts User users email:string password:string password_confirmation:string
----

Generated a bunch of stuff... first let's follow the instructions.

place this line in lib/slang_web/router.ex
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
resources "/users", UserController
----


and the run the migration
[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.migrate
----

now let's have a look to the apps !

[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.server
----

Where to look for nothing changed?

[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.routes
----
You will get a list of routes.
Let's go to http://localhost:4000/users[^] as a starting point

Oh nice an empty list.
Not surprising we might need to create some user... + 
Continue to http://localhost:4000/users/new[^] (you have a link on the previous page) +
keep playing with the different screen for a moment

We have something that nearly looks like a user sign up process :D

Ok awesome on to the next level, stop saving clear password !!! We are not Sony !!! 

== Securing user sign up

=== Virtual Attributes in Schema

let's replace those 2 password attribute in the schema to make them virtual in lib/slang/accounts/user.ex
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
    field :password, :string, virtual: true
    field :password_confirmation, :string, virtual: true
----
and add a new field to store the password_hash
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
    field :password_hash, :string
----

Ok we just changed the database table underneath.
If you look at your postgres table there's those 2 fields, `password` and `password_confirmation`... not quite what we will store now... +
We are going to store `password_hash` +
Let's create a migration to modify our level

ok smarter but not quite nearly done
We need to hash the password, and for that we need a dependency

[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.gen.migration change_user_table
----
it generate a file in the `priv/repo/migrations`

let's open it +
damn it's empty we need to find a way to do our changes... +
take a look on this page : https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sql/Ecto.Migration.html[^] +
and look for something like change or alter or something

once you know what to do run your migration
[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.migrate
----

and check your table in postgres pgadmin3 or 4 or anything you want and see that it has changed :)

ok if you can't make it on the migration, here it is :
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
defmodule Slang.Repo.Migrations.Change_user_table do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    alter table("users") do
      add :password_hash, :text
      remove :password
      remove :password_confirmation
    end
  end
end
----









=== Hashing the password

let's open mix.exs and add a dependency to hash password
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  defp deps do
    [
    ...
        {:comeonin, "~> 4.0"},
        {:bcrypt_elixir, "~> 0.12"},	
    ...
    ]
----

now get those new dependencies and restart our dev environment
[source language='shell',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
----
And we are back up :D

Let's hash this password !

We will do that in the changeset of the schema. +
Changesets allow filtering, casting, validation and definition of constraints when manipulating structs +
When we want to create a record in the database we just pass a Map describing the schema through a changeset pipeline and forward that to the Repo
The Repo is the "instance" that handles the order we pass to the database.

Ok back to our little complicated changeset.
replace the current changeset in the User Schema `lib/slang/accounts/user.ex` by this
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  alias Slang.Accounts.User

  @doc false
  def changeset(%User{} = user, attrs) do
    user
    |> cast(attrs, [:email, :password, :password_confirmation])
    |> validate_required([:email, :password, :password_confirmation])
    |> validate_format(:email, ~r/@/) # Check that email is valid
    |> validate_length(:password, min: 8) # Check that password length is >= 8 
    |> validate_confirmation(:password) # Check that password === password_confirmation
    |> unique_constraint(:email)
    |> put_password_hash # Add put_password_hash to changeset pipeline
  end

  defp put_password_hash(changeset) do
    case changeset do
      %Ecto.Changeset{valid?: true, changes: %{password: pass}}
        ->
          put_change(changeset, :password_hash, Comeonin.Bcrypt.hashpwsalt(pass))
      _ ->
          changeset
    end
  end
----
What does it do ?

the alias is a macro that enable the compiler to use the User Schema inside the changeset itself. It's like an import in other language

- cast : will compare types of the map attributes(attrs) and the types of the User schema
- validate_required : check that everything has been set in the map
- validate_format : validate that the email as a @ somewhere
- validate_length : makes it more complicated to set a password....
- validate_confirmation : will compare the `password` and `password_confirmation`, it's a build in validator... Neat huh?
- unique_constraint : verify that email isn't already registered
- put_password_hash : it's our user defined function bellow

put_password_hash verify that the changeset is valid with an awesome pattern match that verify things andcat same time assign password to pass +
then use Comeonin (our new dependency) to hash the password and return a new changeset with the password_hash attributes set correctly with the hash

tag after those changes is `hashing_password`

pfffewwww... not a bad thing done

Now we can create a user and store it's hashed password and life is good and create, except we have no screen to login !

=== Login Screen 

We will play with phoenix forms and understand how router forms controllers and views interact ! How supremely excited it is ! (is that too much?)

Let's take a look at this http://localhost:4000/users/new[^]

I'd say that it look close to a login screen...
We'll use that as a base for our new login screen !

But first let's create a url for this login page, in `lib/slang_web/router.ex`

Before we change something let me give you some kind of explanations +
How is this router working :

First thing we notice is that pipeline, 
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end
----

What's a pipeline?
As it's name let think it's a pipeline through which every request entering phoenix will transit.
Each step of the pipeline is an elixir plug. A plug is A specification for composable modules between web applications, this is the building block of nearly every web application in Elixir.

so here we will go through:

- verifiy that the request speaks html
- attach the session to the connection (req/resp in phoenix) +
  the session is stored in a JWT token as a cookie comming from the browser. yes we are stateless by default :D
- attach the flash message - specific part of the session to store message for the user, +
  it's a build in mechanism in phoenix - we want to display messages to our user when an action is done during a navigation (saving a form for example)
- protect_from_forgery is pretty explicit - it protects from forgery :)
- secure the browser headers - another security plug to protect the users and the app.

Next in the router is another pipeline used for api - we will see that later in the workshop

Then comes this Scope :
[source language='elixir',subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  scope "/", SlangWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index

    resources "/users", UserController

  end
----

Ok the scope is where the actual routing is done
as you can see this is where we use our browser pipeline.
